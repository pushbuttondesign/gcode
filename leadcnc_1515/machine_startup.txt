#recommended machine startup steps prior to running any gcode file


0. load gcode into openbuilds control and simulate 
1. check X-MAX, Y-MAX, FEED, Z-DEPTH & Z-SAFE values in file match safe machine settings in machine coordinates:
	X-MAX: 0 - 1195mm
	Y-MAX: 0 - 1295mm
	Z-MAX: 0 - -95mm
	Z-SAFE: >-5mm
	XY FEED: 750 - 1500mm/min typical; 3500mm/min max
	Z FEED: 100mm/min typical; 1000mm/min max
	SPINDLE: 10,000 - 30,000 RPM
2. turn on machine and connect to openbuilds control
3. run home cycle after machine switch on using $H
4. G21 to set mm mode
5. G90 to set absolute positioning
6. G28 to move to machine coordinate 0,0,0 (set by $H)
5. G0 XYZ jog to desired start for running file
6. G54 to move to work cordiantes
7. G10 L20 P1 X0 Y0 Z0 to set working coordinates 0,0,0 for G54
8. G92 XYZ to set offset to all working coordinates if desired
8. turn on spindle and run file
